<context> # Overview
TRVL Social is a community-driven adventure platform that eliminates loneliness through meaningful group experiences. Unlike traditional booking platforms that focus on transactions, TRVL Social engineers authentic human connections by matching solo travelers with personality-compatible adventure groups that evolve into lasting friendships beyond the trip itself.
The platform solves the modern loneliness epidemic by transforming travel from isolated consumption into community formation. Targeting "Digital Detox Dana" - Instagram-fatigued 22-year-olds seeking real connections over social media moments - TRVL Social provides structured spontaneity with safety nets for first-time solo travelers.
With 75% of the platform already built, including AI-powered group matching, vendor tools, and a trust-centered glassmorphic UI, TRVL Social is positioned to revolutionize how people connect through shared adventures.

Logical Dependency Chain
Foundation Layer (Must Build First)
	1	Database Schema: Complete data model with relationships
	2	Authentication System: User/vendor registration and login
	3	Core UI Components: Reusable glassmorphic design system
	4	API Structure: RESTful endpoints with proper authentication
Feature Layer (Build on Foundation)
	1	User Profiles: Basic profiles before personality assessment
	2	Adventure Listings: Display before filtering/matching
	3	Basic Booking: Simple bookings before group features
	4	Reviews System: Feedback before compatibility scoring
Intelligence Layer (Requires Features)
	1	Personality Quiz: Needs user profiles to store results
	2	Matching Algorithm: Requires adventure and user data
	3	Group Builder: Needs bookings and personality data
	4	Recommendations: Requires historical booking patterns
Social Layer (Final Enhancement)
	1	Community Forums: After user base established
	2	Connection Features: After successful group adventures
	3	Live Feeds: After content generation
	4	Referral System: After proven user satisfaction
Critical Path to Usable Product

Risks and Mitigations
Technical Risks
Supabase Scaling Limitations
	•	Risk: Database performance issues at scale
	•	Mitigation: Implement Redis caching layer, prepare PostgreSQL migration path, optimize queries with indexes
WhatsApp API Complexity
	•	Risk: Integration challenges and approval delays
	•	Mitigation: Start with email/SMS fallback, build abstraction layer for messaging providers
AI Matching Accuracy
	•	Risk: Poor group compatibility predictions
	•	Mitigation: Start with simple rule-based matching, collect data for ML training, allow manual overrides
Market Risks
Vendor Adoption Resistance
	•	Risk: Vendors reluctant to adopt new platform
	•	Mitigation: Legacy pricing (10% commission forever), white-glove onboarding, free trial period
User Trust in Group Matching
	•	Risk: Users skeptical of personality-based matching
	•	Mitigation: Transparency in algorithms, money-back guarantee, testimonials from beta users
Competition from Established Players
	•	Risk: Viator/GetYourGuide adding social features
	•	Mitigation: Patent provisional for group matching, move fast on community features, vendor lock-in through tools
Operational Risks
Group Dynamic Failures
	•	Risk: Incompatible groups leading to bad experiences
	•	Mitigation: Vendor training on conflict resolution, safety protocols, refund policies, post-adventure support
Payment Processing Complexity
	•	Risk: Split payments and international transactions
	•	Mitigation: Phased rollout by region, manual backup processes, Stripe Connect expertise
MVP Focus Risks
Feature Creep
	•	Risk: Trying to build everything in 3 weeks
	•	Mitigation: Strict sprint planning, daily standups, feature flags for progressive rollout
Quality vs Speed
	•	Risk: Rushing leads to poor user experience
	•	Mitigation: Automated testing, staging environment, beta user program before full launch
