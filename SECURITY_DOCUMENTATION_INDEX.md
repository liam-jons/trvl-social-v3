## 🔑 Credential Management Documentation

### Core Management Systems
1. **[Credential Management Service](./src/services/secure-credentials-service.js)**
   - Supabase Vault integration with AES-256-GCM encryption
   - Runtime credential retrieval with 5-minute cache TTL
   - Automatic fallback to environment variables for development
   - Admin-only access controls with comprehensive audit logging

2. **[Administrative CLI Tools](./scripts/credential-management.js)**
   - `emergency` - Immediate rotation instructions for exposed credentials
   - `migrate` - Secure migration of credentials to Supabase Vault
   - `status` - Comprehensive credential status and compliance reporting
   - `test` - Connectivity validation for all configured services

3. **[Production Setup Framework](./scripts/production-credential-setup.js)**
   - Production readiness assessment (currently 0% - requiring actual keys)
   - Service connectivity testing for critical integrations
   - Automated setup guide generation for missing services
   - Deployment blocker identification and resolution guidance

### Rotation and Compliance
4. **[API Key Rotation Procedures](./docs/API_KEY_ROTATION_PROCEDURES.md)**
   - Service-specific rotation schedules (90-180 day cycles)
   - Emergency rotation procedures (2-24 hour response times)
   - Automated monitoring and compliance verification
   - Step-by-step rotation instructions with pre/post verification

5. **[Credential Monitoring System](./scripts/credential-monitoring.js)**
   - Daily automated health checks via GitHub Actions
   - Multi-tier alerting (critical/warning/notice thresholds)
   - Usage pattern anomaly detection and security incident response
   - Compliance tracking with rotation schedule adherence

## 🛡️ Database Security Implementation

### Secure Storage Architecture
- **Database Migrations**: Complete schema setup in `supabase/migrations/20250920113600_setup_credential_management.sql`
- **Vault Integration**: PostgreSQL-based secure storage with encrypted credential access
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail in `credential_access_logs` and `credential_errors` tables
- **Row Level Security**: Admin-only access policies protecting sensitive credential operations

### Monitoring Tables
```sql
-- Audit trail for all credential operations
credential_access_logs (
  id, credential_key, access_timestamp, success,
  user_id, environment, ip_address, user_agent
)

-- Error tracking for troubleshooting and security analysis
credential_errors (
  id, credential_key, error_message, error_timestamp,
  user_id, environment, resolved
)
```

## ⚙️ Automation and CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflows
1. **[Daily Credential Monitoring](./.github/workflows/credential-monitoring.yml)**
   - Automated daily checks at 9 AM UTC
   - Critical alert GitHub issue creation with action items
   - Multi-channel notifications (Slack, PagerDuty, Email)
   - Production readiness status badge updates

### Alert Integration
- **Slack**: Real-time notifications to #security-alerts channel
- **PagerDuty**: Emergency escalation for critical security incidents
- **GitHub Issues**: Automated ticket creation with rotation guidance and resolution steps
- **Email**: Executive briefings for security incidents and compliance violations

## 📊 Security Metrics and KPIs

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Rotation Compliance**: Target 100% adherence to rotation schedules
- **Mean Time to Rotate (MTTR)**: Target <2 hours for emergency rotation
- **Credential Age**: Continuous monitoring with 30/7/1 day expiration alerts
- **Security Incident Response**: <15 minutes for critical credential exposure

### Monitoring Dashboards
- **Production Readiness**: Real-time percentage calculation based on configured services
- **Credential Health**: Age tracking, expiration predictions, and rotation recommendations
- **Usage Analytics**: API call patterns, failure rates, and anomaly detection
- **Cost Optimization**: Usage-based expense tracking and efficiency recommendations

## 🏗️ Production Deployment Security

### Service Configuration Status
```
🎯 CURRENT PRODUCTION READINESS: 0.0%

📊 SERVICE REQUIREMENTS:
├── Critical Services (4/4 pending):
│   ├── Anthropic API - AI services (EXPOSED - rotate immediately)
│   ├── Stripe Payment - transactions (TEST KEYS - need production)
│   ├── Mapbox Access - location services (PLACEHOLDER)
│   └── WhatsApp Business - messaging (PLACEHOLDER)
│
├── Important Services (3/3 pending):
│   ├── Daily.co - video calls (PLACEHOLDER)
│   ├── Resend - email notifications (PLACEHOLDER)
│   └── Sentry - error tracking (PLACEHOLDER)
│
└── Optional Services (3/3 pending):
    ├── Mixpanel - analytics (PLACEHOLDER)
    ├── Datadog - monitoring (PLACEHOLDER)
    └── Exchange Rate API - currency (PLACEHOLDER)
```

### Deployment Blockers
1. **4 Critical Services** require production credential configuration
2. **Exposed Credentials** must be rotated immediately (Anthropic + Stripe test keys)
3. **Test Credentials** must be replaced with production values before deployment

## 🔧 Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance Schedule
