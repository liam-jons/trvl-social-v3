# Post-Deployment Optimization Tasks

## Critical Security & Performance Tasks

### Console Statement Removal
Remove all console.log, console.warn, and console.error statements from production code across 199 files. Create a utility logger that only outputs in development mode.

### Rate Limiting Implementation
Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints to prevent abuse. Use middleware to limit requests per IP/user with appropriate limits for different endpoint types.

### Error Boundary Implementation
Add comprehensive error boundaries throughout the application with user-friendly fallback UIs and proper error logging to Sentry.

## User Experience Enhancements

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation
Transform the application into a fully functional PWA with offline support, push notifications, and app-like features. Include manifest.json, service worker with caching strategies, offline page, and install prompt UI. Ensure Lighthouse PWA audit score exceeds 90.

### Compatibility Demo Page
Create an interactive compatibility assessment demo page with personality quiz, real-time scoring visualization, sample group matching, and integration with the existing personality assessment system.

### Icon System Standardization
Replace all emoji icons throughout the application with Lucide React icons for a more professional appearance. Ensure consistency across all UI components.

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Size Optimization
Optimize JavaScript bundle sizes by implementing code splitting for the 3 chunks currently exceeding 500KB. Use dynamic imports and lazy loading for large components.

### Image Optimization
Implement proper image optimization including lazy loading, WebP format support, responsive images, and CDN integration for all media assets.

## Testing & Documentation

### Comprehensive Testing Plan
Create and execute a detailed manual testing plan covering authentication flows, booking processes, payment systems, WhatsApp integration, vendor dashboard, and admin functionality.

### API Documentation
Document all API endpoints with request/response examples, authentication requirements, and rate limits for future development reference.

## Content & Legal

### Legal Documentation Update
Update Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy with current business practices and GDPR compliance requirements.

### Placeholder Content Replacement
Identify and replace all placeholder content throughout the application with production-ready copy.
