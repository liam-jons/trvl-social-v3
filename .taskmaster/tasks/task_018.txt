# Task ID: 18
# Title: Optimize bundle sizes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Code split large chunks (>500KB) to improve application performance
# Details:
Three chunks exceed 500KB limit: index.js (1514KB), mapbox-gl.js (1627KB), and several page components. Implement dynamic imports, configure manual chunks in rollup options, and optimize heavy dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify bundle sizes reduced below 500KB, test lazy loading works correctly, ensure no functionality breaks
