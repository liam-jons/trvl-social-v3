# Task ID: 40
# Title: Performance Monitoring Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 38, 39
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Sentry error tracking, Core Web Vitals monitoring, analytics, and comprehensive performance monitoring systems for production.
# Details:
1. Error Tracking Implementation:
   - Set up Sentry for error monitoring and alerting
   - Configure error boundaries in React components
   - Implement custom error logging for API endpoints
   - Set up performance monitoring for slow queries and requests
   - Configure user feedback collection for error reports

2. Core Web Vitals Monitoring:
   - Implement Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) tracking
   - Monitor First Input Delay (FID) and responsiveness
   - Track Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) for visual stability
   - Set up alerts for performance regression
   - Implement real user monitoring (RUM)

3. Analytics Implementation:
   - Set up Google Analytics 4 with enhanced ecommerce
   - Implement custom event tracking for user interactions
   - Track conversion funnels and user journey analytics
   - Set up cohort analysis and retention tracking
   - Implement A/B testing infrastructure

4. Application Performance Monitoring (APM):
   - Monitor API response times and database queries
   - Track memory usage and garbage collection patterns
   - Implement distributed tracing for microservices
   - Monitor real-time features and WebSocket performance
   - Set up synthetic monitoring for critical user paths

5. Business Intelligence Dashboards:
   - Create executive dashboards for key metrics
   - Set up automated reporting for performance trends
   - Implement custom alerts for business-critical events
   - Create performance comparison and benchmark reports

# Test Strategy:
1. Monitoring System Validation:
   - Verify error tracking captures and reports issues correctly
   - Test alert systems trigger for performance regressions
   - Validate analytics data accuracy and completeness

2. Performance Metrics Testing:
   - Verify Core Web Vitals measurements are accurate
   - Test synthetic monitoring covers critical user paths
   - Validate APM data correlates with actual performance

3. Dashboard and Reporting Testing:
   - Verify dashboards display real-time and accurate data
   - Test automated report generation and distribution
   - Validate alert thresholds and notification systems

4. User Experience Impact:
   - Ensure monitoring tools don't negatively impact performance
   - Test monitoring overhead on application speed
   - Verify privacy compliance for analytics tracking
