I'll analyze the codebase to understand the current implementation and provide specific guidance for the vendor onboarding flow.With Task 10.1 fully implemented and all core Stripe Connect infrastructure in place, the vendor onboarding flow can now leverage the comprehensive backend services and APIs. The implementation should focus on creating a multi-step UI flow that integrates with the existing StripeConnectOnboarding component at /src/components/stripe/StripeConnectOnboarding.jsx.

Key implementation areas based on the codebase analysis:

1. **Enhanced Multi-Step Onboarding UI**: Expand the basic StripeConnectOnboarding component into a full multi-step wizard with vendor profile creation, business details collection, and Stripe Connect account setup. Integrate with vendorService (/src/services/vendor-service.js) for creating vendor records in the database.

2. **Vendor Registration Flow**: Create a new VendorRegistrationPage that combines vendor profile creation with Stripe onboarding, accessible from /register/vendor route. Link this from the existing VendorDashboardPage which currently shows "Vendor Registration Required" at line 66.

3. **Onboarding Status Tracking**: Implement onboarding progress tracking using the vendor_stripe_accounts table created in the migration, showing steps like: Profile Setup â†’ Business Information â†’ Stripe Connect â†’ Verification â†’ Approval. Store progress in database and display in vendor dashboard.

4. **Integration Points**: 
   - Connect the vendor onboarding to the existing auth system via useAuth hook
   - Use the stripeConnect service methods from /src/services/stripe-service.js
   - Update user role to 'vendor' upon successful onboarding completion
   - Integrate with the existing GlassCard and GlassButton UI components for consistent styling

5. **Webhook-Driven Status Updates**: Leverage the webhook handlers at /api/stripe/webhooks.js to automatically update vendor status when Stripe sends account.updated events, enabling real-time onboarding progress updates.

6. **Return URL Handling**: Configure proper return and refresh URLs in the Stripe onboarding links to handle users returning from Stripe's hosted onboarding, updating the vendor dashboard to show onboarding completion status.

The foundation is solid - now focus on building the user-facing flow that guides vendors through profile creation and Stripe Connect setup seamlessly.

## 2. Build vendor onboarding flow with Stripe Connect [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create complete vendor registration and verification process through Stripe
### Details:
Implement vendor registration API endpoint to create connected accounts. Build onboarding UI flow with account verification steps. Create dashboard for vendors to complete Stripe requirements. Implement document upload for KYC compliance. Set up bank account connection for payouts. Create vendor status tracking in database. Build notification system for onboarding updates.

<info added on 2025-09-14T19:35:52.978Z>
I'll analyze the codebase to understand the current implementation and provide specific details for the subtask update.Implementation progress update: Analyzed existing Stripe infrastructure. Found complete Stripe Connect service (stripe-service.js:106-233) with createAccount, createOnboardingLink, getAccountStatus methods. Basic StripeConnectOnboarding component exists (StripeConnectOnboarding.jsx) but needs significant enhancement. API endpoints properly configured in /api/stripe/ directory with authentication and Supabase integration. Database schema already created (vendor_stripe_accounts table with full KYC fields, requirements tracking, and status management). Current setup uses @stripe/stripe-js but missing @stripe/react-stripe-js for React components. Need to enhance existing UI with proper KYC document upload (requirements fields already in DB schema), implement requirement tracking using existing requirements_past_due/currently_due/eventually_due columns, add real-time status monitoring leveraging charges_enabled/payouts_enabled flags, integrate file upload for identity verification documents, enhance vendor dashboard integration (found VendorDashboardLayout.jsx and VendorDashboardPage.jsx), and implement webhook handlers for account.updated events (webhook structure exists in webhooks.js:344-381). Will proceed with npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js, enhance StripeConnectOnboarding with full KYC flow, implement document upload component for identity verification, create vendor onboarding status dashboard, and integrate with existing vendor dashboard components.

## 3. Create payment UI components with Stripe Elements [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Build secure payment form components using Stripe's PCI-compliant UI elements
### Details:
Integrate Stripe Elements for card input with React components. Create reusable PaymentForm component with validation. Implement saved payment methods functionality.

Style components to match application design system.
<info added on 2025-09-14T19:36:47.954Z>
I'll analyze the codebase to understand the current implementation and provide specific guidance for the payment UI components implementation.Implementation started. Need to install @stripe/react-stripe-js dependency. Will create src/components/stripe/PaymentForm.jsx and src/components/stripe/PaymentMethodSelector.jsx following the glass morphism design system. Components will use existing stripe-service.js for getStripe() initialization. Will implement CardElement, PaymentElement with 3D Secure support, and integrate Apple Pay/Google Pay through Payment Request API. Components will be fully PCI-compliant using Stripe Elements, handle loading states with glass-styled spinners, and provide comprehensive error handling with toast notifications. Payment method management will include saved cards display, default selection, and removal functionality.
