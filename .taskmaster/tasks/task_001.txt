# Title: Setup Tailwind CSS and Glassmorphic Design System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphic components and establish the trust-centered design system foundation
# Details:
Install and configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS. Create custom utility classes for glassmorphic effects using backdrop-filter, blur, and transparency. Set up CSS variables for theme colors, spacing, and typography. Implement base components: GlassCard, GlassButton, GlassModal with proper backdrop-blur-md, bg-white/10, border-white/20 styling. Configure responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design. Set up dark mode support with CSS custom properties.

# Test Strategy:
Visual regression testing using Storybook or similar tool. Verify glassmorphic effects render correctly across browsers. Test responsive breakpoints at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px. Validate WCAG 2.1 color contrast ratios. Performance testing for blur effects on mobile devices.
