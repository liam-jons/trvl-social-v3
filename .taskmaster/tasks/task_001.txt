# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Tailwind CSS and Glassmorphic Design System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphic components and establish the trust-centered design system foundation
# Details:
Install and configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS. Create custom utility classes for glassmorphic effects using backdrop-filter, blur, and transparency. Set up CSS variables for theme colors, spacing, and typography. Implement base components: GlassCard, GlassButton, GlassModal with proper backdrop-blur-md, bg-white/10, border-white/20 styling. Configure responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design. Set up dark mode support with CSS custom properties.

# Test Strategy:
Visual regression testing using Storybook or similar tool. Verify glassmorphic effects render correctly across browsers. Test responsive breakpoints at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px. Validate WCAG 2.1 color contrast ratios. Performance testing for blur effects on mobile devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Tailwind CSS with PostCSS configuration and integrate with Vite build process
### Details:
Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies (postcss, autoprefixer). Create postcss.config.js with Tailwind and autoprefixer plugins. Initialize tailwind.config.js with content paths for React components. Add Tailwind directives (@tailwind base, components, utilities) to main CSS file. Configure Vite to process PostCSS. Set up purge/content configuration for production builds to minimize CSS bundle size.

## 2. Create Glassmorphic Utility Classes and CSS Variables [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop custom utility classes for glassmorphic effects and establish CSS variable system for theming
### Details:
Create CSS custom properties for glass effects (--glass-blur, --glass-opacity, --glass-border). Define utility classes for backdrop-filter effects (.glass-blur-sm, .glass-blur-md, .glass-blur-lg). Set up transparency utilities for glass backgrounds (.bg-glass-light, .bg-glass-dark). Create border utilities for glass edges (.border-glass). Establish CSS variables for theme colors (primary, secondary, accent), spacing scale, and typography (font families, sizes, line heights). Configure color palette for trust-centered design.

## 3. Build Core Glassmorphic Components [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement GlassCard, GlassButton, and GlassModal base components with proper styling
### Details:
Create GlassCard component with backdrop-blur-md, bg-white/10, border border-white/20, rounded corners, and shadow effects. Implement GlassButton with hover/active states, size variants (sm, md, lg), and color variants. Build GlassModal with overlay backdrop, glass panel, and proper z-index management. Add TypeScript interfaces for component props. Implement forwarding refs for all components. Create compound components pattern where applicable. Ensure all components support className prop for extension.

## 4. Configure Responsive Breakpoints and Dark Mode [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up mobile-first responsive design system and dark mode support with CSS custom properties
### Details:
Configure Tailwind breakpoints for mobile-first design (xs: 320px, sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px, 2xl: 1440px). Implement dark mode using Tailwind's dark variant and class strategy. Create CSS custom properties that switch based on dark mode preference. Update glassmorphic components to adapt blur and opacity values for dark mode. Set up useTheme hook for programmatic theme control. Configure system preference detection and localStorage persistence for theme preference.

## 5. Set Up Storybook for Component Visual Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Install and configure Storybook for component documentation and visual regression testing
### Details:
Install Storybook for React with Vite builder. Configure Storybook to load Tailwind CSS and custom styles. Create stories for all glassmorphic components showing different states and variants. Set up controls/args for interactive component testing. Configure viewport addon for responsive testing. Implement dark mode toggle in Storybook toolbar. Create MDX documentation pages for design system guidelines. Set up visual regression testing with Chromatic or Percy integration if needed.
