# Task ID: 38
# Title: Production Infrastructure Setup and Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 34, 36
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure production environment variables, logging systems, rate limiting, CDN for assets, and monitoring infrastructure for production deployment.
# Details:
1. Environment Configuration:
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Configure secure credential management
   - Implement environment-specific configurations
   - Set up deployment pipeline variables

2. Logging Infrastructure:

   - Set up log aggregation and search capabilities
   - Configure error tracking and alerting
   - Implement audit logging for security events

3. Rate Limiting Implementation:
   - Configure API rate limiting by endpoint and user
   - Implement DDoS protection measures
   - Set up rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Configure progressive rate limiting for abuse prevention

4. CDN and Asset Optimization:
   - Configure CDN for static asset delivery
   - Implement image optimization and compression
   - Set up caching strategies for different content types
   - Configure geographic distribution for performance

5. Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Set up application performance monitoring
   - Configure uptime monitoring and health checks
   - Implement custom metrics and dashboards
   - Set up alerting for critical system events

6. Security Infrastructure:
   - Configure SSL/TLS certificates and HTTPS enforcement
   - Set up security headers and HSTS
   - Implement intrusion detection systems
   - Configure backup and disaster recovery procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Infrastructure Testing:
   - Verify all environment variables are properly configured
   - Test logging systems capture and store events correctly
   - Validate rate limiting triggers at configured thresholds

2. Performance Testing:
   - Test CDN performance and cache hit rates
   - Measure asset loading times from different geographic locations
   - Verify caching strategies work as expected

3. Security Testing:
   - Verify SSL/TLS configuration and certificate validity
   - Test security headers and HTTPS enforcement
   - Validate backup and recovery procedures

4. Monitoring Validation:
   - Test alert triggering for various scenarios
   - Verify monitoring dashboards display accurate data
   - Test notification systems for critical events
