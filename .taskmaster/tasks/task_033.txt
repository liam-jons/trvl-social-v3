# Task ID: 33
# Title: Replace Placeholder Content with Production Assets
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Systematically replace all placeholder content including test API keys, example.com emails, Lorem ipsum text, and external image dependencies (67 instances) with production-ready content to ensure security and professionalism.
# Details:
1. Create an inventory spreadsheet documenting all 67 identified placeholder instances:
   - Map test API keys to production credentials
   - Document example.com email addresses and their intended production values
   - List all Lorem ipsum text locations and required final content
   - Catalog external image dependencies and their local alternatives

2. Implement replacements in phases:
   a) Security-critical items:
      - Replace test API keys with production credentials from secure vault
      - Update environment variables and .env files
      - Remove any hardcoded credentials
   
   b) Content updates:
      - Replace Lorem ipsum text with approved marketing copy
      - Update example@example.com addresses with proper contact information
      - Replace placeholder usernames/profiles with proper defaults
   
   c) Image dependencies:
      - Download and optimize all required images
      - Store images in project assets directory
      - Update image paths in components
      - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
      
3. Update documentation:
   - Remove references to placeholder content
   - Update README with proper email contacts
   - Update configuration guides with production values

4. Security considerations:
   - Ensure no credentials are committed to version control
   - Validate all API keys are properly encrypted
   - Verify email addresses are properly sanitized
   - Implement proper image asset access controls

# Test Strategy:
1. Automated Scanning:
   - Run automated search for common placeholder patterns (lorem ipsum, example.com, test@)
   - Execute security scan for exposed API keys
   - Verify no external image dependencies in production build

2. Manual Testing:
   - Visual inspection of all pages for remaining placeholder content
   - Verify all images load properly and are served from correct locations
   - Test all email functionality with production addresses
   - Validate API functionality with production credentials

3. Documentation Review:
   - Review all technical documentation for placeholder content
   - Verify README and configuration guides show production-ready information

4. Production Build Verification:
   - Build production bundle and inspect source
   - Check network requests for external dependencies
   - Verify no test/development content appears in production logs
   - Validate proper loading of all assets and content
