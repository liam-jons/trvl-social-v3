# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Core UI Layout and Navigation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main application layout with responsive navigation and routing structure
# Details:
Implement main layout component with header, footer, and content area using glassmorphic design. Create responsive navigation menu with mobile hamburger menu. Set up React Router v6 with nested routes for all main sections. Build community navigation tabs (Local/Regional/Global) with active state management. Implement breadcrumb navigation for nested pages. Create loading states and error boundaries. Build notification system for user feedback. Implement progressive enhancement for JavaScript-disabled browsers.

# Test Strategy:
Component testing with React Testing Library. Test responsive navigation at different breakpoints. Verify routing works correctly with browser back/forward. Test error boundaries with simulated errors. Accessibility testing with screen readers. Performance testing for route transitions.

Configure lazy loading for route components using React.lazy() and Suspense. Add route-level error boundaries with ErrorBoundary components. Implement scroll restoration on route changes. Create NotFound component for 404 pages.

## 4. Implement Community Navigation Tabs with State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3

Build CommunityTabs.jsx component with Local (<50mi), Regional (<500mi), and Global tab options. Implement tab state management using React Context or URL parameters for deep linking. Add smooth transition animations between tab switches using CSS transforms. Create visual indicators for active tab with glassmorphic highlighting. Implement swipe gestures for mobile tab navigation. Add badge notifications for new content in each tab. Store user's last selected tab preference in localStorage. Ensure tabs are keyboard navigable with proper focus management.

## 5. Create Loading States and Error Boundaries [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Build comprehensive loading components and error boundary system for graceful error handling throughout the application
