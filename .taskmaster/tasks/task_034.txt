CRITICAL SECURITY SCAN FINDINGS:

Exposed Production Credentials:
- Live Anthropic API key (sk-ant-api03-*)
- Live Stripe API keys (pk_test_51* and sk_test_51*)
- Stripe webhook secret (whsec_*)

Widespread Credential Issues:

- 47+ placeholder API keys detected in production/staging environments
- Affected services: Mapbox, WhatsApp, Daily.co, Mixpanel, Sentry, Datadog
- Development placeholder keys in production contexts (e.g. re_dev_placeholder)

Security Risk Assessment:
- Critical exposure of live production credentials in repository
- Multiple environment files containing sensitive patterns
- Git history contains credential traces
- Improper environment variable management across deployment contexts
- Lack of secrets rotation mechanism

Required Immediate Actions:
1. Rotate all exposed production credentials
2. Remove environment files from version control
3. Migrate to secure credential management system
4. Replace all placeholder keys with proper production values
5. Clean repository history of sensitive data
