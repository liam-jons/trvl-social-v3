# Task ID: 39
# Title: Optimize Bundle Size and Performance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 36
# Priority: medium
# Description: Continue optimizing bundle size, building on successful reduction from 31MB to 20MB, with focus on resolving remaining static import issues and implementing remaining optimization strategies.
# Details:
1. Completed TensorFlow.js Optimization:
   - Implemented lazy-ml-loader.js for on-demand loading
   - Separated TensorFlow into own chunk (285KB gzipped)
   - Created lazy-assessment-service.js wrapper
   - Added ML availability detection and fallbacks

2. Remaining Static Import Resolution:
   - Refactor assessment-service.js in onboarding-service.js
   - Decouple ML services in ml-service.js
   - Optimize demo component imports
   - Implement TensorFlow.js Lite migration

3. Image Optimization Rollout:
   - Deploy OptimizedImage.jsx component across app
   - Complete WebP conversion for remaining assets
   - Finalize CDN integration configuration
   - Implement remaining responsive image patterns

4. Performance Monitoring Implementation:
   - Integrate performance-monitoring.js into main app
   - Set up Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Configure bundle loading metrics
   - Implement performance budget alerts

5. Additional Optimizations:
   - Complete tree shaking optimization
   - Finalize external dependency configuration
   - Implement remaining compression strategies
   - Configure service worker caching

# Test Strategy:
1. Bundle Size Verification:
   - Confirm maintenance of 20MB total bundle size
   - Verify TensorFlow.js chunk size (285KB target)
   - Test lazy loading triggers
   - Monitor chunk distribution

2. Performance Metrics:
   - Track Core Web Vitals improvements
   - Measure lazy loading effectiveness
   - Verify performance budget compliance
   - Test real user scenarios

3. Integration Testing:
   - Verify OptimizedImage component implementation
   - Test static import refactoring
   - Validate service worker functionality
   - Check CDN integration

4. User Experience Validation:
   - Test ML feature availability detection
   - Verify image loading improvements
   - Measure perceived performance
   - Validate graceful fallbacks
