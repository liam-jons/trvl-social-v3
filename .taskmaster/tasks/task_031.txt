# Task ID: 31
# Title: Fix CORS Security with Specific Domain Origins
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 19, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace wildcard CORS origins with explicit allowed domains in all API endpoints and Supabase functions to enhance security and prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.
# Details:
1. Audit all API endpoints and Supabase functions for current CORS configurations
2. Create an environment variable ALLOWED_ORIGINS to store approved domains
3. Update Next.js API route configurations:
   - Modify next.config.js to include specific CORS headers
   - Replace any '*' origins with process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS
   - Implement middleware/cors.ts to handle CORS headers consistently
4. Update Supabase function configurations:
   - Access Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions
   - Modify each function's CORS policy using supabase functions config set
   - Set --cors-origins flag with specific domain list
5. Implement CORS error handling:
   - Add proper error responses for unauthorized origins
   - Log unauthorized access attempts
6. Document all allowed origins in project documentation
7. Consider implementing Origin validation middleware
8. Update development environment to use localhost:3000 explicitly
9. Ensure WebSocket connections have proper CORS settings for real-time features

# Test Strategy:
1. Create automated tests to verify CORS headers:
   - Test successful requests from allowed origins
   - Verify requests from unauthorized origins are blocked
   - Check OPTIONS preflight requests return correct headers
2. Test in multiple environments:
   - Local development
   - Staging
   - Production
3. Create specific test cases:
   - API endpoints with different HTTP methods
   - Supabase function calls
   - WebSocket connections
   - File upload endpoints
4. Use tools like Postman or curl to test CORS headers:
   - Verify Access-Control-Allow-Origin
   - Check Access-Control-Allow-Methods
   - Validate Access-Control-Allow-Headers
5. Monitor CORS-related errors in production logs
6. Perform security scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP
7. Document all test results and CORS configurations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Current CORS Configurations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all API endpoints and Supabase functions with wildcard CORS origins
### Details:
Scan all API routes in /pages/api/, /api/, and Supabase Edge Functions for current CORS settings. Document which endpoints use '*' origins and identify security vulnerabilities.
<info added on 2025-09-20T09:24:38.865Z>
Security audit findings for CORS configurations:

17 instances of wildcard CORS origins identified across the codebase:
- 15 API route files in /api/stripe/* and /src/api/compatibility/* directories using '*' origin
- 1 Supabase Edge Function (verify-age) with unrestricted CORS access
- Multiple production endpoints handling sensitive payment data and user information exposed to CSRF attacks

Key vulnerabilities:
- Stripe payment processing endpoints allowing unrestricted cross-origin access
- Age verification function accepting requests from any domain
- Compatibility API endpoints exposed without origin validation
- Bulk operations and cache endpoints accessible from unauthorized sources

Limited existing security measures:
- Two API routes implement proper CORS using environment variables:
  - /api/stripe/connect/accounts.js
  - /api/stripe/connect/account-links.js

Recommendation: All identified endpoints require immediate CORS restriction to authorized domains via environment variables to prevent unauthorized access and potential CSRF attacks.

## 2. Create Environment Variable for Allowed Origins [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Set up ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable with production domains
### Details:
Create ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable containing comma-separated list of approved domains (e.g., 'https://trvlsocial.com,https://www.trvlsocial.com,https://admin.trvlsocial.com')
<info added on 2025-09-20T09:33:38.959Z>
Environment variable configuration completed with the following implementation details:

- Added ALLOWED_ORIGINS and VITE_APP_URL to .env.example with documentation
- Created two CORS configuration utility files:
  1. /src/utils/cors-config.js for Node.js API routes
  2. /src/utils/cors-config.ts for Supabase Edge Functions

Implementation includes environment-aware origin validation, secure CORS headers configuration, preflight request handling, unauthorized access logging, and TypeScript support for Edge Functions. Both utilities provide middleware functions for seamless integration with respective environments.

Testing verified proper origin validation against environment variables and correct CORS header generation across development and production environments.

## 3. Update Next.js API Route CORS Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Replace wildcard origins in Next.js API routes with specific domain validation
### Details:
Modify next.config.js and create middleware/cors.ts to handle CORS headers consistently. Replace any '*' origins with process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS validation.

Progress update on API route CORS security implementation:

Successfully updated 9 API endpoints with secure CORS configuration:
- /api/stripe/connect/payouts/index.js
- /api/stripe/connect/transfers.js
- /api/stripe/confirm-payment.js
- /supabase/functions/verify-age/index.ts
- /src/api/compatibility/cache.ts
- All handler functions now use createCorsResponse utility
- Removed manual CORS header management
- Implemented withCors wrapper with secure headers
- Origins validated against ALLOWED_ORIGINS env variable

Remaining API routes requiring CORS updates:
- /api/stripe/connect/files.js
- /api/stripe/payment-methods.js
- /api/stripe/connect/transfers/index.js
- /api/stripe/payments/index.js
- /api/stripe/connect/payouts.js
- /src/api/compatibility/config.ts
- /src/api/compatibility/bulk.ts
- /src/api/compatibility/calculate.ts

Development environment configured to fallback to localhost origins when ALLOWED_ORIGINS is not set.

## 4. Update Supabase Function CORS Policies [done]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Configure Supabase Edge Functions with specific CORS origins
### Details:
Access Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions and modify each function's CORS policy using 'supabase functions config set --cors-origins' with specific domain list.

- Origin validation successfully filters allowed/blocked domains
- CORS headers properly configured for authorized origins
- Unauthorized and null origins correctly rejected
- Security headers implemented and verified
- Development environment properly handles localhost origins
