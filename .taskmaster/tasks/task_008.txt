# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Trip Request UI with Natural Language Input [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the user interface for trip requests where users can describe their dream adventures in natural language
### Details:
Design and implement a trip request form with a large text area for natural language input. Include helper prompts and examples to guide users (e.g., 'Describe your ideal adventure: dates, destination, activities, budget'). Add optional structured fields for basic info (date range picker, budget slider, group size). Implement character count and validation. Create mobile-responsive design with proper input handling. Add ability to save drafts and view previous requests. Include file upload for inspiration images.

I'll analyze the codebase to understand the current implementation and provide specific details for the NLP parsing subtask.COMPLETED: Create NLP parsing service at src/services/nlp-service.js that integrates with OpenAI API (or fallback to Anthropic Claude if configured) to extract structured data from natural language trip descriptions. The service should:

1. Parse trip descriptions from TripRequestPage.jsx (lines 8-15 formData structure) and extract:
   - Destinations/locations mentioned
   - Date ranges (flexible parsing for various formats)
   - Budget information (per person or total)
   - Group size
   - Activities and interests
   - Accommodation preferences
   - Special requirements (dietary, accessibility, etc.)

2. Implement prompt engineering to handle the variety of example prompts shown in TripRequestPage.jsx (lines 140-145) and return structured JSON matching the expected schema

3. Include intelligent fallback parsing using regex patterns for common formats when AI API is unavailable

4. Add response validation and error handling for malformed API responses

5. Integrate with existing AI service pattern from ai-service.js (lines 10-19 for config, lines 28-73 for caching, lines 147-217 for API calls with retry logic)

6. Support both OPENAI_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variables (as shown in .env.example lines 6-8) with automatic provider selection

7. Create comprehensive test suite similar to ai-service.test.js to validate parsing accuracy across diverse input formats

8. Implement rate limiting and cost optimization strategies (batch processing, caching parsed results keyed by description hash)

9. Add support for parsing inspiration images if provided (future enhancement hook)

10. Structure the service to be easily callable from the trip request submission handler in TripRequestPage.jsx line 121-123

Key implementation files created/modified:
- src/services/nlp-service.js (new - main NLP parsing service)
- src/services/nlp-service.test.js (new - comprehensive test suite)
- src/utils/nlp-patterns.js (new - regex patterns for fallback parsing)
- Integration point ready at TripRequestPage.jsx line 121 for API submission
