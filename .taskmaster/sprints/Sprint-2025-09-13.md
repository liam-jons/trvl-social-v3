# Sprint-2025-09-13

## Sprint Goals
Based on critical path analysis and dependencies:

### Primary Goals (Must Complete)
- [x] Task 1: Setup Tailwind CSS and Glassmorphic Design System
  - Foundation for all UI components
  - No dependencies, can start immediately
- [x] Task 2: Configure Supabase Database Schema (Partial - Core tables)
  - Critical foundation for all data operations
  - Focus on subtasks 2.1-2.7 (core tables and RLS)

### Secondary Goals (If Time Permits)
- [ ] Task 3: Implement Authentication and User Management (Partial)
  - Subtasks 3.1-3.3 (Basic auth setup)
  - Depends on Task 2 completion
- [ ] Task 4: Build Core UI Layout and Navigation (Partial)
  - Subtasks 4.1-4.3 (Main layout and routing)
  - Depends on Task 1 completion

## Team Assignments
- **Frontend Developer**: Task 1 (Days 1-2), Task 4 (Days 5-6)
- **Backend Developer**: Task 2 (Days 1-4), Task 3 (Days 4-6)
- **Full-Stack Support**: Assist where needed, focus on integration

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Foundation Setup
- Morning: Task 1.1-1.2 (Tailwind installation and glassmorphic utilities)
- Afternoon: Task 2.1 (Core database table design)

### Day 2: Design System & Database
- Morning: Task 1.3-1.4 (Core components and responsive config)
- Afternoon: Task 2.2-2.3 (User, vendor, and booking tables)

### Day 3: Database Completion
- Morning: Task 2.4-2.6 (Groups, community, trip tables)
- Afternoon: Task 2.7 (RLS policies setup)

### Day 4: Authentication Start
- Morning: Task 2.8-2.10 (Database functions and optimization)
- Afternoon: Task 3.1-3.2 (Supabase auth setup and registration)

### Day 5: Authentication & UI
- Morning: Task 3.3 (Login/logout functionality)
- Afternoon: Task 4.1-4.2 (Main layout and navigation)

### Day 6: Polish & Integration
- Morning: Task 4.3 (Router setup)
- Afternoon: Integration testing and documentation

## Key Milestones
- **Day 2 EOD**: Design system complete, database design finalized
- **Day 4 EOD**: Database fully configured with RLS, auth backend ready
- **Day 6 EOD**: Basic authenticated app with UI framework

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Tailwind and glassmorphic components working
- ✅ Database schema deployed with all core tables
- ✅ User can register and login
- ✅ Basic navigation and routing functional
- ✅ All tests passing

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Database complexity might delay other tasks
  - **Mitigation**: Frontend can proceed with mock data if needed
- **Risk**: Supabase RLS policies complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Start with basic policies, iterate in next sprint
- **Risk**: Integration issues between frontend and backend
  - **Mitigation**: Daily sync meetings, shared API contracts

## Notes
- MCP server connection issues noted - using CLI directly for task-master commands
- Focus on foundation - no feature work this sprint
- Document all architectural decisions for future sprints
- Create API contracts early for frontend/backend coordination

## Commands Reference
```bash
# Update task status
npx task-master-ai set-status --id=1 --status=in-progress

# Check dependencies
npx task-master-ai validate-dependencies

# Daily monitoring
./scripts/sprint-monitor.sh

# Get next task
